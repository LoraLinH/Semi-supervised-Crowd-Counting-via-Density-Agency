## Dataset Preparation
1. Dowload Dataset.
2. The Preprocess Code can be referred to [MAN](https://github.com/LoraLinH/Boosting-Crowd-Counting-via-Multifaceted-Attention).

## Train
1. Change the path to where your data and models are located in 'train.py'.
2. Run 'train.py'
3. Wait patiently and happily for the program to finish.
4. Then you will get a good counting model!


## Test
1. Change the path to where your data and models are located in 'test.py'.
2. Run 'test.py'.
